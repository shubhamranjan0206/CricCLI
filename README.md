# CricCLI
This is a python script which allows users to see live cricket scores easily via notifications on their mac. Users would have option to see after which event they want to see score. For e.g. after each over, after each wicket, etc.

## Motivation
Sometimes when I am working on some stuff, or watching movie or doing anything and if cricket match is going on at the same time, then it becomes very difficult to follow it. Hence, the intention was to create an script for mac which uses notifications to display score.

## Using
1. Download the **cricket.py** script.
2. Open terminal in that folder and invoke the script
```sh
python3 -W ignore cricket.py
```

## Dependencies
1. python3 - https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. BeautifulSoup4 - https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/
